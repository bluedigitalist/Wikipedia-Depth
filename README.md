The depth or editing depth of Wikipedia is one of several possible rough indicators of the encyclopedia's collaborative quality, showing how frequently its articles are updated.

It does not refer to academic quality, which cannot be computed, but to Wikipedian quality, i.e. the depth of collaborativenessâ€”a descriptor that is highly relevant for a Wikipedia. 

Definition

The formula assumes that a relatively high number of page edits and the presence of support pages means articles have been updated. And the latter support pages are assumed to be a more important factor. 

In the list of Wikipedias, depth is currently defined as: 

Depth = \frac{Edits}{Total}\times \left ( \frac{Non-Articles}{Articles} \right )^{2}

OR

[latex]Depth=\frac{Edits}{Total}\times\left(\frac{Non-Articles}{Articles}\right)^{2}[/latex]
